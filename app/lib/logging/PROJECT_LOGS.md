# ✅ Log File Location Updated

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Logs Now in Project Directory
**Location**: `app/logs/app_YYYY-MM-DD.log`

**Before**:
- Logs were in `C:\Users\{username}\Documents\logs\`
- Hard to find
- Not visible in project

**After**:
- Logs are in `calendar/app/logs/`
- Easy to find in your IDE
- Part of your project structure
- Can view directly in VS Code

### 2. ✅ Added to .gitignore
**File**: `app/.gitignore`

Added these lines:
```gitignore
# Application logs
logs/
*.log
```

**Result**:
- Log files won't be committed to git
- Won't clutter your repository
- Each developer gets their own logs
- Verified with `git status` - logs directory is ignored ✓

## How to Find Your Logs

### In VS Code
1. Open the Explorer panel
2. Navigate to `app/logs/`
3. Click on `app_2025-10-16.log`
4. View logs directly in the editor!

### In Terminal
```powershell
# View entire log file
Get-Content logs/app_$(Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd).log

# View last 20 lines
Get-Content logs/app_$(Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd).log -Tail 20

# Watch in real-time
Get-Content logs/app_$(Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd).log -Wait
```

### Current Log File
**Path**: `app/logs/app_2025-10-16.log`

**Contents** (with LogLevel.info):
```
[2025-10-16T22:06:29.168424] [INFO] [main] Application starting
[2025-10-16T22:06:29.171967] [INFO] [main] MyApp widget created successfully
[2025-10-16T22:06:29.339104] [INFO] [HomePage] HomePage initialized
[2025-10-16T22:06:32.118500] [INFO] [HomePage] User reached 5 taps milestone!
[2025-10-16T22:06:34.466872] [WARN] [HomePage] User has tapped 10 times
[2025-10-16T22:06:35.466531] [ERROR] [HomePage] Tap count exceeds expected range
```

## Code Changes

### logger.dart
**Removed**:
```dart
final dir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
final logDir = Directory('${dir.path}/logs');
```

**Added**:
```dart
// Use project directory for logs (easier to find and review)
final logDir = Directory('logs');
```

**Also removed**:
- `import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';` (no longer needed)

### .gitignore
**Added**:
```gitignore
# Application logs
logs/
*.log
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Easier to Find
- Right in your project
- Visible in VS Code Explorer
- No hunting through system directories

### ✅ Version Control Safe
- Logs ignored by git
- Won't accidentally commit logs
- Clean repository

### ✅ Team Friendly
- Each developer gets their own logs
- No conflicts
- No merge issues

### ✅ Portable
- Works the same on all platforms
- Relative path (no hardcoded directories)
- Project-centric

## Log File Management

### Automatic Rotation
- New file created each day
- Format: `app_YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- Old logs auto-deleted after 7 days (configurable)

### Current Behavior
- **Today's log**: `logs/app_2025-10-16.log`
- **Tomorrow**: `logs/app_2025-10-17.log` (auto-created)
- **Old logs**: Deleted after 7 days automatically

### Manual Cleanup
```powershell
# Delete all logs
Remove-Item logs/*.log

# Delete logs older than 3 days
Get-ChildItem logs/*.log | Where-Object {$_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-3)} | Remove-Item
```

```bash
$ git status

## Summary

✅ **Logs in project**: `app/logs/app_YYYY-MM-DD.log`
✅ **Easy to find**: Right in your project structure
✅ **Git ignored**: Won't be committed
✅ **Working perfectly**: Tested and verified
✅ **Log level control**: Still one line in main.dart

**You can now easily view your logs in VS Code!** 🎉
